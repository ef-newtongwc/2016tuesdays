    <title>Surfing In New England</title>

<h1>Surfing is Amazing.</h1>

<p> Sadly, not everyone has perfect beaches and amazing waves.
Here in New England, the weather is frigid and the waves are mediocre or non existence most of the time.</p>
No Matter, surfing is the best sport ever and I love it.<br>
